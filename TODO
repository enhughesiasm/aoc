1) Write my own generator that scaffolds a new year using the new execution system
2) Tidy existing 2023 code, improve the shared lib
3) Do previous years, improving the shared lib as we go
4) Go back to all the TODO: optimise comments and speed up the solutions so the tests run in reasonable time
5) Testing is slow; make it so we can run subset tests, i.e. just one year, or just a day
