0. finish 2016 day 10
1. rewrite 2016 day 1 to use line intersection code

2. Go through 2015/2023 and rejig the shared lib to make best use of it all; rewrite solutions
   a) Grid.ts
   - class to handle Compass/Directions etc, manage moving about and flood fill and general
     manipulation
     GO back and resolve old grid problems using the class, and improve it
     SAME WITH
     b) maths.ts
     c) Parsing.ts
     d) Strings.ts
     and a Vector/Line management thing (like 2016 day 1 above)
     e) CycleDetection higher order function would be cool
3. optimise some of the less good solutions
4. figure out attaching a debugger dynamically
5. Finish 2016 - 2022
6. Unit test the shared lib as well
7. Go back to all the TODO: optimise comments and speed up the solutions so the tests run in reasonable time
