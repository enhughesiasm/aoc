1. Simplify the test format in both existing tests AND the TEST_TEMPLATE

- Change it so the year is a constant const YEAR = YEAR_REPLACEMENT;
- Remove the day numbers, so the array is just a tuple of answers:
  const answers = [ [PART_ONE, PART_TWO], [PART_ONE, PART_TWO], etc ]

2. Tidy existing 2023 code, improve the shared lib
3. Do previous years, improving the shared lib as we go
4. Go back to all the TODO: optimise comments and speed up the solutions so the tests run in reasonable time
5. Testing is slow; make it so we can run subset tests, i.e. just one year, or just a day
